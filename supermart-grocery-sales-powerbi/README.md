# Workshop Project: Supermart Grocery Sales Analysis

This project was developed during a professional workshop to practice end-to-end data storytelling. Using a dataset of a supermarket's grocery sales, I built an interactive dashboard to transform raw data into business insights.
## Key Insights & Objectives

- Financial Summary: The business generated a total revenue of 15M with a total profit of 4M.
- Top Performing Region: The West Region led all areas, contributing 32.08% (approximately 4.8M) to the total revenue.
- Best-Selling Category: Eggs, Meat & Fish was identified as the top category by revenue and order count.
- Growth Trend: Revenue showed a strong upward trajectory by 2018, reaching a peak of 5.0M.
- Sales Density: The analysis covered operations across 24 cities.
- Consumer Behavior: The Bakery category maintained high order volume despite a 14.72% average discount.
## Tech Stack

**Data Cleaning: Standardizing city and category names via Power Query.

**Visual Storytelling: Using Map visuals, Area charts, and Treemaps to represent regional and temporal data.
